# Installing Requirements

Download the repository as a zip file or using git

After downloading the repository, install the requirements by running ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` inside the project folder

If you are on an M1/M2 mac, you will also have to install libusb natively using Homebrew. Installing the Python requirements will not be enough.
